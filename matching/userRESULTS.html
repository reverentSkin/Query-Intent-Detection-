<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&quot;Where could I find a place to sleep with a bike storage?&quot;      Given the advice I can provide, I think my typical guest could be a motorcyclist to discover my land.   Province of Bari </p>

I therefore feel obliged to help other riders like me in the mood for new discoveries.       The direct experience in the field allows me not only to be credible, but above all to be able to perfectly understand what the needs of a guest biker like me might be. In practice, because I am a biker too. I am an affable person and I recognize that I have some empathic ability that allows me to get in touch with people right away  The Diocesan Museum of Taranto is a mandatory visit! </p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">One of the most fascinating routes in the area is the &quot;overview&quot; of Monopoli. To be taken seriously into consideration</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">I am extremely passionate about caving, I like to explore the hundreds of caves that Puglia has to offer. I am also interested in participating in and organizing cultural events. Furthermore, I was part of the Manufacta collective, a group of young boys dedicated to promoting the typical manufacturing production of the area.  I know in particular the various ancient shops in the historic center of Martina Franca: blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers and artisan ceramics producers, and I can recommend a &quot;tour&quot; of the shops. My passion for caving has led me to discover many caves spread over the territory of the Valle d'Itria. I can therefore help in organizing a speleological tour limited to visiting the &quot;entrances&quot; of the caves.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&quot;Are there life forms in caves?&quot;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&quot;Is there breathable air in the cave?&quot; </p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&quot;How to deal with the problem of claustrophobia?&quot;       My ideal guest would surely be a lover of nature, looking for an unconventional experience, a different and magical tour.

I have always been intrigued by the history of my land, and I am a good source of stories and stories about folklore. To the love for my land is also added a certain passion for food in general and for its typical products in general.     I have a deep knowledge of the territory, in particular of the lesser known but still suggestive places, and of the people who populate it. For me, the key to anyone who comes to discover my land is the ability to identify with the territory, to grasp its authentic identity, giving value to the knowledge of both traditions and culture as well as history. I am also a good fork and can put my experiences at your disposal to better direct the guest in choosing the place to eat.

They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit; therefore, a smaller cylinder or cylinders, may be used for an equivalent dive duration.

Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.', 'label': 'Fashion', 'categories': ['Fashion', 'Cultural trends', 'History of clothing'], 'types': [], 'image': {'full': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/1796-short-bodied-gillray-fashion-caricature.jpg', 'thumbnail': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/1796-short-bodied-gillray-fashion-caricature.jpg?width=300'}, 'lod': {'dbpedia': 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fashion', 'wikipedia': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion'}}, {'start': 198, 'end': 211, 'spot': 'Made In Italy', 'confidence': 0.6521, 'id': 42214122, 'title': 'Made in Italy', 'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Italy', 'abstract': 'Made in Italy is a merchandise mark indicating that a product is all planned, manufactured and packed in Italy.', 'label': 'Made in Italy', 'categories': ['Country of origin', 'Business in Italy'], 'types': [], 'image': {'full': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Made_in_Italy.png', 'thumbnail': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Made_in_Italy.png?width=300'}, 'lod': {'dbpedia': 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Made_in_Italy', 'wikipedia': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Italy'}}, {'start': 236, 'end': 254, 'spot': 'plus-size clothing', 'confidence': 0.8798, 'id': 4698763, 'title': 'Plus-size clothing', 'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus-size_clothing', 'abstract': &quot;Plus size clothing is a term given to clothing proportioned specifically for people whose bodies are larger than the average person's.

Carpentry in the United States is almost always done by men. With 98.5% of carpenters being male, it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999, and there were about 1.5 million positions in 2006. Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave. Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old fashioned carpentry is called timber framing. Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and South Africa.
